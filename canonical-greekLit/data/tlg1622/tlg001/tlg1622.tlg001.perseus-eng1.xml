<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>I rejoice also that your firmly<note type="marginal" resp="editor">Their faith</note> rooted faith, which was famous in past years, still flourishes and bears fruit unto our Lord Jesus Christ, who endured for our sins, even to the suffering of death, <q>whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of Hades,</q></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>but remembering what the Lord taught<note type="marginal" resp="editor">The Lord’s teaching</note> when he said, <q>Judge not that ye be not judged, forgive and it shall be forgiven unto you, be merciful that ye may obtain mercy, with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again,</q> and, <q>Blessed are the poor, and they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.</q></p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For neither am I, nor is any other like me, able to follow the wisdom of the blessed and glorious Paul, who when he was among you in the presence of the men of that time taught accurately and stedfastly the word of truth, and also when he was absent wrote letters to you, from the study of which you will be able to build yourselves up into the faith given you;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p><q>which is the mother of us all</q> when faith follows, and love of God and Christ and neighbour goes before. For if one be in this company lie has fulfilled the command of righteousness, for he who has love is far from all sin.</p></div> 
  </div>  
  <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent"><q>But the beginning of all evils is the love of<note type="marginal" resp="editor">Exhortations to virtue</note> money.</q> Knowing therefore that <q>we brought nothing into the world and we can take nothing out of it,</q> let us arm ourselves with the armour of righteousness, and let us first of all teach ourselves to walk in the commandment of the Lord;</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>next teach our wives to remain in the faith given to them, and in love and purity, tenderly loving their <pb xml:id="p.289"/> husbands in all truth, and loving all others equally in all chastity, and to educate their children in the fear of God.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Let us teach the widows to be discreet in the faith of the Lord, praying ceaselessly for all men, being far from all slander, evil speaking, false witness, love of money, and all evil, knowing that they are an altar of God, and that all offerings are tested, and that nothing escapes him of reasonings or thoughts, or of <q>the secret things of the heart.</q></p></div>

  <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Knowing then that <q>God is not mocked</q> we<note type="marginal" resp="editor">Christian obligations to a virtuous life</note> ought to walk worthily of his commandment and glory.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Likewise must the deacons be blameless; before his righteousness, as the servants of God and Christ and not of man, not slanderers, not double-tongued, not lovers of money, temperate in all things, compassionate, careful, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who was the <q>servant of all.</q> For if we please him in this present world we shall receive from him that which is to come; even as he promised us to raise us from the dead, and that if we are worthy citizens of his community, <q>we shall also reign with him,</q> if we have but faith.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Likewise also let the younger men be blameless in all things; caring above all for purity, and curbing themselves from all evil; for it is good to be cut off from the lust of the things in the world, because <q>every lust warreth against the Spirit, and neither fornicators nor the effeminate nor sodomites shall <pb xml:id="p.291"/> inherit the Kingdom of God,</q> nor they who do iniquitous things. Wherefore it is necessary to refrain from all these things, and to be subject to the presbyters and deacons as to God and Christ. The virgins must walk with a blameless and pure conscience.</p></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">And let the presbyters also be compassionate.<note type="marginal" resp="editor">The duties of the presbyters</note> merciful to all, bringing back those that have wandered, caring for all the weak, neglecting neither widow, nor orphan nor poor, but <q>ever providing for that which is good before God and man,</q> refraining from all wrath, respect of persons, unjust judgment, being far from all love of money, not quickly believing evil of any, not hasty in judgment, knowing that <q>we all owe the debt of sin.</q><note type="footnote" resp="editor">The introductory formula <q>knowing that</q> renders it probable that these words are a quotation, but the source is unknown.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>If then we pray the Lord to forgive us, we also ought to forgive, for we<note type="marginal" resp="editor">Forgiveness</note> stand before the eyes of the Lord and of God, and <q>we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and each must give an account of himself.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>So then <q>let us serve him with fear and all reverence,</q> as he himself commanded us, and<note type="marginal" resp="editor">The service of God</note> as did the Apostles, who brought us the Gospel, and the Prophets who foretold the coming of our Lord. Let us be zealous for good, refraining from offence, and from the false brethren, and from those who bear the name of the Lord in hypocrisy, wdio deceive empty-minded men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Wherefore, leaving the foolishness of the crow d, and their false teaching, let us turn back to the word which was delivered to us in the beginning, <q>watching unto prayer</q> and persevering in fasting, beseeching the all-seeing God in our supplications <q>to lead us not into temptation,</q> even as the Lord said, <q>The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</q></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Let us then be imitators of his endurance, and if we suffer for his name’s sake let us glorify him. For this is the example which he gave us in himself, and this is what we have believed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>When you can do good defer it not, <q>for almsgiving sets free from death; be ye all subject one to the other, having your conversation blameless among the Gentiles,</q> that you may receive praise <q>for your good works</q> and that the Lord be not blasphemed in you.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But I have neither perceived nor heard any such thing among you, among whom the blessed Paul laboured, who are praised in the beginning of his Epistle.<note type="footnote" resp="editor">The Greek was perhaps <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς οὖσιν ἐν ἀρχῇ ἐπιστολαῖς αὐτοῦ</foreign>, and ought to be rendered <q>who were his epistles in the beginning,</q> with a reference to II Cor. 3, 2.</note> For concerning you he boasts in all the Churches who then alone had known the Lord, for we had not yet known him.</p></div>
