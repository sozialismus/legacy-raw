<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="1"><head>Vision 1</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">He who brought me up sold me to a certain<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Hermas and Rhoda</note> Rhoda at Rome. After many years I made her acquaintance again, and began to love her as a sister.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">As it stands this is hardly intelligible: presumably the meaning is that Hermas was born a slave, and that his owner sold him to Rhoda. It is implied that he then passed out of her possession, and later on made her acquaintance again. The alternative is that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνεγνωρισἀμην</foreign> merely means <q type="translation">came to know her properly.</q> </note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>After some time I saw her bathing in the river Tiber, and gave her my hand and helped her out of the river. When I saw her beauty I reflected in my heart and said: <q>I should be happy if I had a wife of such beauty and character.</q> This was my only thought, and no other, no, not one.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>After some time, while I was<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Hermas goes to Cumae</note> going to Cumae, and glorifying the creation of God, for its greatness and splendour and might, as I walked along I became sleepy. And a spirit seized me and took me away through a certain pathless district, through which a man could not walk, but the ground was precipitous and broken up by the <pb xml:id="p.9"/> streams of water. So I crossed that river, and came to the level ground and knelt down and began to pray to the Lord and to confess my sins.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Now while I was praying the Heaven was opened, and I<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The Vision of Rhoda speaking from Heaven</note> saw that woman whom I had desired greeting me out of the Heaven and saying: <q>Hail, Hermas.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And I looked at her, and said to her: <q>Lady, what are you doing here?</q> and she answered me: <q>I was taken up to accuse you of your sins before the Lord.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>I said to her: <q>Are you now accusing me?</q> <q>No,</q> she said, <q>but listen to the words which I am going to say to you. <q>God who dwells in Heaven</q>  and created that which is out of that which is not, and <q>increased and multiplied it,</q>  for the sake of his Holy Church, is angry with you because you sinned against me.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>I answered and said to her: <q>Did I sin against you? In what place, or when did I speak an evil word to you? Did I not always look on you as a goddess? Did I not always respect you as a sister? Why do you charge me falsely. Lady, with these wicked and impure things?</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>She laughed and said to me: <q>The desire of wickedness came up in your heart. Or do you not think that it is an evil deed for a righteous man if an evil desire come up in his heart? Yes, it is a sin,</q> said she, <q>and a great one. For the righteous man has righteous designs. So long then as his designs are righteous his repute stands fast in Heaven, and he finds the Lord ready to assist him in all his doings. But they who have evil designs in their hearts bring upon themselves death and captivity, especially those who obtain this world for <pb xml:id="p.11"/> themselves, and glory in their wealthy and do not lay hold of the good things which are to come.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p><q rend="merge">Their hearts will repent; yet have they no hope, but they have abandoned themselves and their life. But do you pray to God, and <q>He shall heal the sins of yourself,</q> and of all your house and of all the saints.</q></p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">After she had spoken these words the Heavens<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The vision of the ancient lady</note> were shut, and I was all shuddering and in grief. And I began to say in myself: <q>If this sin is recorded against me, how shall I be saved? Or how shall I propitiate God for my completed sins? Or with what words shall I beseech the Lord to be forgiving unto me?</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>While I was considering and doubting these things in my heart I saw before me a white chair of great size made of snow-white wool; and there came a woman, old and clothed in shining garments with a book in her hand, and she sat down alone and greeted me: <q>Hail, Hermas!</q> And I, in my grief and weeping, said: <q>Hail, Lady!</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And she said to me: <q>Why are you gloomy, Hermas? You who are patient and good-tempered, who are always laughing, why are you so downcast in appearance and not merry?</q> And I said to her: <q>Because of a most excellent lady, who says that I sinned against her.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And she said: <q>By no means let this thing happen to the servant of God; but for all that the thought did enter your  <pb xml:id="p.13"/> heart concerning her. It is such a design as this which brings sin on the servants of God. For it is an evil and mad purpose against a revered spirit and one already approved, if a man desire an evil deed, and especially if it be Hennas the temperate, who abstains from every evil desire and is full of all simplicity and great innocence.</q></p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent"><q rend="merge">But it is not for this that God is angry with<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Why God is angry</note> you, but in order that you should convert your family, which has sinned against the Lord, and against you, their parents. But you are indulgent, and do not correct your family, but have allowed them to become corrupt. For this reason the Lord is angry with you, but he will heal all the past evils in your family, for because of their sins and wickednesses have you been corrupted by the things of daily life.</q></p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p><q rend="merge">But the great mercy of the Lord has had pity on you and on your family, and will make you strong and will establish you in his glory; only do not be slothful, but have courage and strengthen your family. For as the smith, by hammering his work, overcomes the task which he desires, so also the daily righteous word overcomes all wickedness. Do not cease, then, correcting your children, for I know that if they repent with all their heart, they will be inscribed in the books of <pb xml:id="p.15"/> life with the saints.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>After she had ceased these words she said to me: <q>Would you like to hear me<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The lady reads to Hermas</note> read aloud?</q> and I said: <q>I should like it, Lady.</q> She said to me: <q>Listen then, and hear the glory of God.</q> I heard great and wonderful things which I cannot remember; for all the words were frightful, such as a man cannot bear. So I remembered the last words, for they were profitable for us and gentle:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><q>Lo, <q>the God of the powers,</q> whom I love, by his mighty power, and by his great wisdom <q>created the world,</q> and by his glorious counsel surrounded his creation with beauty, and by his mighty word <q>fixed the Heaven and founded the earth upon the waters,</q> and by his own wisdom and forethought created his holy Church, which he also blessed—Lo, he changes the heavens, and the mountains and the hills and the seas, and all things are becoming smooth for his chosen ones, to give them the promise which he made with great glory and joy, if they keep the ordinances of God, which they received with great faith.</q></p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">So, when she had finished reading, and rose<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The close of the vision</note> from the chair, there came four young men, and took up the chair and went away towards the East.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And she called me and touched my breast and said <pb xml:id="p.17"/> to me; <q>Did my reading please you?</q> and I said to her: <q>Lady, this last part pleases me, but the first part was hard and difficult.</q> And she said to me: <q>This last part is for the righteous, but the first part was for the heathen and the apostates.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>While she was speaking with me two men appeared, and took her by the arm and they went away towards the East, whither the chair had gone. But she went away cheerfully, and as she went said to me, <q>Play the man, Hermas.</q></p></div></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="2"><head>Vision 2</head> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">While I was going to Cumae, at about the<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The second vision at Cumae</note> same time as the year before, as I walked along I remembered the vision of the previous year, and the spirit again seized me and took me away to the same place, where I had been the previous year.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>So when I came to the place, I knelt down and began to pray to the Lord and <q>to glorify his name,</q> because he had thought me worthy, and had made known to me my former sins.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But after I rose from prayer I saw before me the ancient lady,<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The ancient lady returns</note> whom I had seen the year before, walking and reading out from a little book. And she said to <pb xml:id="p.19"/> me: <q>Can you take this message to God’s elect ones?</q> I said to her: <q>Lady, I cannot remember<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The little book</note> so much; but give me the little book to copy.</q> <q>Take it,</q> she said, <q>and give it me back.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>I took it and went away to a certain place in the country, and copied it all, letter by letter, for I could not distinguish the syllables.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">Hermas no doubt means that it was written, like most early MSS., in a continuous script with no divisions between the words.</note> So when I had finished the letters of the little book it was suddenly taken out of my hand; but I did not see by whom.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">But after fifteen days, when I had fasted and<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The contents of the little book</note> prayed greatly to the Lord, the knowledge of the writing was revealed to me. And these things were written:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Your seed, Hermas, have set God at naught, and have blasphemed the Lord, and have betrayed their parents in great wickedness, and they are called the betrayers of parents, and their betrayal has not profited them, but they have added to their sins wanton deeds and piled up wickedness, and so their crimes have been made complete.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>But make these words known to all your children and to your wife, who shall in future be to you as a sister. For she also does not refrain her tongue, with which she sins; but when she has heard these words she will refrain it, and will obtain mercy.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>After you have made known these words to them, which the <pb xml:id="p.21"/> Master commanded me to reveal to you, all the sins which they have formerly committed shall be forgiven them, and they shall be forgiven to all the saints who have sinned up to this day,<note resp="editor" type="footnote">This is the main point of the <q type="title">Shepherd.</q>  The primitive teaching was that for sin after baptism no repentance is possible (cf. Heb. vi.). Hermas now states that it has been revealed to him that <q type="mentioned">up to this day,</q>  i.e. the time of his revelation, sin will be forgiven to the repentant. But this offer of forgiveness will not be made a second time.</note> if they repent with their whole heart, and put aside double-mindedness from their heart.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>For the Master has sworn to his elect by his glory that if there be still sin after this day has been fixed, they shall find no salvation; for repentance for the just has an end; the days of repentance have been fulfilled for all the saints, but for the heathen repentance is open until the last day.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>You shall say, then, to the leaders of the Church, that they reform their ways in righteousness, to receive in full the promises with great glory.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>You, therefore, <q>who work righteousness,</q> must remain steadfast and be not double-minded, that your passing may be with the holy angels.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">Cf. Herm. <title>Sim.</title> ix,  25 and Martyr. Polycarp, ii 3 with the note on the latter passage as to the doctrine of a transformation of the just into angels after their death.</note> Blessed are you, as many as endure the great persecution which is coming, and as many as shall not deny their life.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>For the Lord has sworn by his Son that those who have denied their Christ have been rejected from their life, that is, those who shall now deny him in the days to come. <pb xml:id="p.23"/> But those who denied him formerly have obtained forgiveness through his great mercy.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent"><q>But, Hermas, no longer bear a grudge against your children, nor neglect your sister, that they may be cleansed from their former sins. For they will be corrected with righteous correction, if you bear no grudge against them. The bearing of grudges works death. But you, Hermas, had great troubles of your own because of the transgressions of your family, because you did not pay attention to them. But you neglected them and became entangled in their evil deeds.</q></p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p><q rend="merge">But you are saved by not <q>having broken away from the living God,</q> and by your simplicity and great temperance. These things have saved you, if you remain in them, and they save all whose deeds are such, and who walk in innocence and simplicity. These shall overcome all wickedness and remain steadfast to eternal life.</q></p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p><q rend="merge"><q>Blessed,</q> are all they <q>who do righteousness</q> ; they shall not perish for ever.</q></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">And a revelation was made to me, brethren.<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The revelation as to the ancient lady</note> while I slept, by a very beautiful young man who said to me, <q>Who do you think that the ancient lady was from whom you received the little book?</q> I said, <q>The Sibyl.</q> <q>You are wrong,</q> he said, <q>she is not.</q> <q>Who is she, then?</q> I said. <q>The Church,</q> he said. I said to him, <q>Why then is she old?</q> <q>Because,</q> he said, <q>she was created the first of all things. For this reason is she old; and for her sake was the world established.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And afterwards I saw a vision in my house. The ancient<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The ancient lady returns</note> lady came and asked me if I had already given the book to the elders.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">The third vision which I saw, brethren, was as<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The ancient lady comes again</note> follows:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>I had fasted for a long time, and prayed  <pb xml:id="p.27"/> the Lord to explain to me the revelation which he had promised to show me through that ancient lady; and in the same night the ancient lady appeared to me and said to me: <q>Since you are so importunate and zealous to know everything, come into the country, where you are farming, and at the fifth hour I will appear to you, and show you what you must see.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>I asked her, saying, <q>Lady, to what part of the field?</q> <q>Where you like,</q> she said. I chose a beautiful secluded spot; but before I spoke to her and mentioned the place she said to me, <q>I will be there, where you wish.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>I went, therefore, brethren, to the country, and I counted the hours, and I came to the spot where I had arranged for her to come, and I saw a couch of ivory<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The couch of ivory</note> placed there, and on the couch there lay a linen pillow, and over it a covering of fine linen was spread out.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>When I saw these things lying there, and no one in the place I was greatly amazed, and, as it were, trembling seized me and my hair stood on end. And, as it were, panic came to me because I was alone. When therefore I came to myself, and remembered the glory of God and took courage, I knelt down and confessed my sins again to the Lord, as I had also done before.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>And she came with<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The six young men</note> six young men, whom I had also seen on the former occasion, and stood by me, and listened to me praying and confessing my sins to the Lord.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>And she raised me up by the hand and took me to the couch and said to the young men: <q>Go and build.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>And after the young men had gone away and we were alone, she said to me: <q>Sit here.</q> I said to her: <q>Lady, let the elders sit first.</q><note resp="editor" type="footnote">The meaning is obscure: <q type="mentioned">the elders</q>  is often explained as <q type="translation">the Elders of the Church,</q>  but it is more probably a mere formula of politeness <q type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">seniores priores.</q> </note> She said: <q>Do what I tell you, and sit down.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Yet when I wished to sit<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Hermas and the couch</note> on the right hand she would not let me, but signed to me with her hand to sit on the left.

The seat on the<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The place of the martyrs</note> right is for others, who have already been found well-pleasing to God and have suffered for the Name. But you fall far short of sitting with them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Now the tower was being built four-square by the six young men who had come with her; but tens of thousands of other men were bringing stones, some from the deep sea, and some from the land, and were giving them to the six young men, and these kept taking them and building.</p></div>

And he chose out a certain servant, who was faithful, in good esteem and honour with him, and he called him and said to him: <q>Take this vineyard which I have planted, and fence it until I come, and do nothing more to the vineyard. And follow this order of mine and you shall have your freedom from me. And the master of the servant went abroad.</q></q></p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p><q rend="merge">Now when he had gone the servant took and fenced the vineyard, and when he had finished the fencing of the vineyard he saw that the vineyard was full of weeds.</q></p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><q rend="merge">Therefore he reasoned in himself, saying: I have finished this order of the Lord; I will next dig this vineyard, and it will be better when it is dug, and having no weeds will yield more fruit, not being choked by the weeds.

  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><q rend="merge">After a time the master of the servant and the field came, and entered into the vineyard, and seeing the vineyard beautifully fenced, and moreover dug, and all the weeds pulled up and <pb xml:id="p.157"/> vines fertile, he was greatly pleased at the acts of the servant.</q></p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p><q rend="merge">So he called his beloved son, whom he had as heir, and his friends whom he had as counsellors, and told them what he had ordered his servant, and what he had found accomplished.

  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><q rend="merge">And he said to them: I promised this servant his freedom if he kept the orders which I gave him. Now he has kept my orders, and has added good work in the vineyard, and greatly pleased me. So in reward for this work which he has done I wish to make him joint heir with my son, because, when he had a good thought he did not put it on one side, but carried it out.</q></p></div>
  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><q rend="merge">The son of the master agreed with this plan, that the servant should be joint heir with the son.</q></p></div>

  <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p><q rend="merge">And his fellow-servants were glad when they received the food, and began to pray for him, that he might find greater favour with his master, because he had treated them thus.</q></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Therefore he commanded all these to be taken away from the tower, and to be put beside the tower, and other stones to be brought and laid in their place.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p><q>Because,</q> said he, <q>all the nations which dwell under heaven, when they heard and believed were called after the name of the Son of God.
