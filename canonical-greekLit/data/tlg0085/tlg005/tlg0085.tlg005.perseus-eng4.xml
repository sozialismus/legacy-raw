            Translator’s preface
            
               
            <milestone unit="para"/>MAY I be permitted to chat a little, by way of recreation,
                  at the end of a somewhat toilsome and perhaps fruitless
                  adventure?
            <milestone unit="para"/>If, because of the immense fame of the following
                  Tragedy, I wished to acquaint myself with it, and could
                  only do so by the help of a translator, I should require
                  him to be literal at every cost save that of absolute
                  violence to our language.  The use of certain allowable
                  constructions which, happening to be out of daily favour,
                  are all the more appropriate to archaic workmanship, is
                  no violence: but I would be tolerant for once,—in the
                  case of so immensely famous an original,—of even a
                  clumsy attempt to furnish me with the very turn of each
                  phrase in as Greek a fashion as English will bear: while,
                  with respect to amplifications and embellishments,—anything rather than, with the good farmer, experience that
                  most signal of mortifications, <quote>to gape for Aeschylus and
                  get Theognis.</quote> I should especially decline,—what may
                  appear to brighten up a passage,—the employment of a
                  new word for some old one—<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόνος</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγας</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλος</foreign>,
                  with its congeners, recurring four times in three lines:
                  for though such substitution may be in itself perfectly
                  justifiable, yet this exercise of ingenuity ought to be
                  within the competence of the unaided English reader
                  if he likes to show himself ingenious. Learning Greek
                  teaches Greek, and nothing else: certainly not common
                  sense, if that have failed to precede the teaching. Further,—if I obtained a mere strict bald version of thing
                  by thing, or at least word pregnant with thing, I should
                  hardly look for an impossible transmission of the reputed
                  magniloquence and sonority of the Greek; and this with
                  the less regret, inasmuch as there is abundant musicality
                  elsewhere, but nowhere else than in his poem the ideas
                  of the poet.  And lastly, when presented with these
                  ideas, I should expect the result to prove very hard
                  reading indeed if it were meant to resemble Aeschylus,

                  when, looking about for an example of the truly obscure
                  for the benefit of those who found obscurity in the sacred
                  books, he protested that this particular play leaves them
                  all behind in this respect, with their <quote>Hebraisms, Syriasms,
                  Hellenisms, and the whole of such bag and baggage.</quote><note anchored="true">

                  For, over and above the purposed ambiguity of the Chorus,
                  the text is sadly corrupt, probably interpolated, and certainly mutilated; and no unlearned person enjoys the
                  scholar’s privilege of trying his fancy upon each obstacle
                  whenever he comes to a stoppage, and effectually clearing the way by suppressing what seems to lie in it.
            <milestone unit="para"/>All I can say for the present performance is, that I
                  have done as I would be done by, if need were. Should
                  anybody, without need, honour my translation by a comparison with the original, I beg him to observe that,
                  following no editor exclusively, I keep to the earlier
                  readings so long as sense can be made out of them, but
                  disregard, I hope, little of importance in recent criticism
                  so far as I have fallen in with it.  Fortunately, the
                  poorest translation, provided only it be faithful,—though
                  it reproduce all the artistic confusion of tenses, moods,
                  and persons, with which the original teems,—will not
                  only suffice to display what an eloquent friend maintains
                  to be the all-in-all of poetry—<quote>the action of the piece</quote>—
                  but may help to illustrate his assurance that <quote>the Greeks
                  are the highest models of expression, the unapproached
                  masters of the grand style: their expression is so excellent because it is so admirably kept in its right degree
                  of prominence, because it is so simple and so well subordinated, because it draws its force directly from the
                  pregnancy of the matter which it conveys . . . not a
                  word wasted, not a sentiment capriciously thrown in,
                  stroke on stroke!</quote><note anchored="true">

            <milestone unit="para"/>Just a word more on the subject of my spelling—in a
                  transcript from the Greek and there exclusively—Greek
                  names and places precisely as does the Greek author. I
                  began this practice, with great innocency of intention,
                  some six-and-thirty years ago. Leigh Hunt, I remember,
                  was accustomed to speak of his gratitude, when ignorant
                  of Greek, to those writers (like Goldsmith) who had
                  obliged him by using English characters, so that he
                  might relish, for instance, the smooth quality of such a
                  phrase as <q type="foreign">hapalunetai galené;</q> he said also that Shelley
                  was indignant at <q type="emph">Firenze</q> having displaced the Dantesque <q type="emph">Fiorenza,</q> and would contemptuously English
                  the intruder <q type="emph">Firence.</q> I supposed I was doing a simple
                  thing enough: but there has been till lately much astonishment
                  at <mentioned>os</mentioned> and <mentioned>us</mentioned>, <mentioned>ai</mentioned> and <mentioned>oi</mentioned>, representing the same
                  letters in Greek.  Of a sudden, however, whether in
                  translation or out of it, everybody seems committing the
                  offence, although the adoption of <mentioned>u</mentioned> for <mentioned>v</mentioned> still presents
                  such difficulty that it is a wonder how we have hitherto
                  escaped <q type="emph">Eyripides.</q> But there existed a sturdy Briton
                  who, Ben Jonson informs us, wrote <title>The Life of the
                  Emperor Anthony Pie</title> — whom we now acquiesce in as
                  Antoninus Pius: for <quote>with time and patience the mulberry
                  leaf becomes satin.</quote> Yet there is, on all sides, much
                  profession of respect for what Keats called <quote>vowelled
                  Greek</quote> — <q type="emph">consonanted,</q> one would expect; and, in a
                  criticism upon a late admirable translation of something
                  of my own, it was deplored that, in a certain verse corresponding in measure to the fourteenth of the sixth
                  Pythian Ode, <quote>neither Professor Jebb in his Greek, nor
                  Mr. Browning in his English, could emulate that matchlessly musical <cit>
